                    <p class="p1">Husband and wife co-founders Ikaika and Ilikea Smith started Dry Oar River Rafting 
                    after years of river rafting adventures together.  They actually met at a river rafting instructor training camp back in 2010
                    in Colorado.  They both have been certified instructors since 2010 and have taught and guided people
                    on rivers all around the world!</p>

                  <p class="p1s">Bill comes to us from Hawaii.  He has spent the past 
                     5 years as a certified river rafting instructor with Dry Oar.  
                    He is especially great with the little ones, being a father of 3 children with his wife
                  Janie who is also an instructor with us.  His specialty is helping anyone overcome their fear, if they 
                are afraid or if this is their first time riding the rapids.</p>

                  <p class="p1s">Janie is originally from Michigan.  She is the wife of Bill.  They met in Hawaii while
                     she was on vacation.  Janie has been river rafting since she was little.  She's been working as a certified
                    rafting instructor for 8 years, 5 of them being with Dry Oar.  Like Bill, she is amazing with kids, but her 
                    specialty is teaching.  She helps with re-certification of our entire staff!</p>

                    rapids in all countries.  Born in Nevada, he has fond memories of riding the rapids in the Grand Canyon with
                    his family.  He has 10 years of certification and specializes in safety.  He is our newest staff member, just

                <p class="pcom">Being a work at home mom has its ups and downs. Yes, you have the
                    option of rolling out of bed
                    and going straight to "work" or rather your home office. Yes, you get
                    to avoid hours of traffic and
                    driving to work. You don't have to worry about packing a breakfast or
                    a lunch because you can
                    take advantage of your 24 hour kitchen whenever you feel hungry. There
                    are so many pros to
                    working from home. But wait a second, are you telling me that you also
                    have a baby that you have
                    care for? Well, that just changes EVERYTHING now doesn't it? There are
                    so many things that others don't realize are going on in the
                    background as a work-at-home
                    mama with a newborn! Nothing like working to the tune of your newborn
                    crying and possibly screaming
                    because surprise, surprise! -- baby is hungry or wants to be held or
                    needs a diaper change. Whatever it is, that baby needs your attention
                    RIGHT NOW, and no customer
                    or group meeting, or boss even, is going to change that. Not so easy
                    typing out that report with one
                    hand while the other arm is holding baby. Don't even get me started
                    with sleep deprivation - because
                    sleep is a distant memory -- sigh --. And yet there's sometimes an
                    unspoken expectation to perform as
                    good, if not better than before returning from your amazing maternity
                    leave vacation because let's face it:
                    you weren't working, so it was definitely a vacation! Does any of this
                    resonate with you? Whatever you're going through, whatever you feel,

                <p class="pcom"> There are
                    so many things that others don't realize are going on in the
                    background as a work-at-home
                    mama with a newborn! Nothing like working to the tune of your newborn
                    crying and possibly screaming
                    because surprise, surprise! -- baby is hungry or wants to be held or
                    needs a diaper change. Whatever it is, that baby needs your attention
                    RIGHT NOW, and no customer
                    or group meeting, or boss even, is going to change that. Not so easy
                    typing out that report with one
                    hand while the other arm is holding baby. Don't even get me started
                    with sleep deprivation - because
                    sleep is a distant memory -- sigh --. And yet there's sometimes an
                    unspoken expectation to perform as
                    good, if not better than before returning from your amazing maternity
                    leave vacation because let's face it:
                    you weren't working, so it was definitely a vacation! Does any of this
                    resonate with you? Whatever you're going through, whatever you feel,

                    <p>"First of all, so grateful this website 
                        exists!  I've learned some great tips
                        from this site and the community 
                        from amazing women who really know how 
                        to get things done!  I don't know what I 
                        would've done without this website because
                        there truly isn't another like it!"

                    <p>"Get yourself a sit-stand desk!
                        My little one needs to be near
                        me 24/7!  As soon as I put her down
                        it's nothing, but screaming and 
                        crying.  Having the sit-stand desk with
                        my baby carrier keeps my sweet girl 
                        happy and I'm able to actually get 
                        some work done!"

                    <p>"I have made so many friends in this community!
                        It amazes me because I'm super shy and asking 
                        for help is so hard for me, but the moms 
                        are so kind and we're all just helping 
                        eachother!  I've also learned so much from
                        their stories of failures and triumphs!  And 
                        I love the reviews on products!"

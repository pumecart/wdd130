                <p>
                    Congratulations mama on your newborn! Yes, let's take a deep breath
          and have a moment to celebrate you and the fact that you just had a baby! Hopefully you
          take time to remind yourself
          everyday just how special you are -- especially since that sacred
          mommy and baby time will soon
          have to include WORK. And let's talk about work because that is
          specifically what this website
          is all about, but not just any work. We're talking about work at home
          with your newborn!
          If you're here it's because you're looking for solutions to questions
          like, "How am I supposed
          to work AND care for my newborn at the same time?" You're looking for
          ideas on ways to refresh
          your work space to suite you and your baby. You're also looking for
          other mamas who are going
          through the same thing because lately you've been thinking, "I can't
          be the ONLY mama going
          through these struggles!" You are not alone! We welcome you into this
          unique, but ever growing
          group of mamas who are figuring it things out and sharing it all right
          here!

                <h2>Congratulations & Welcome to the Club!</h2>
                <p>
                    Congratulations mama on your newborn! Yes, let's take a deep breath
          and have a moment to<br />
          celebrate you and the fact that you just had a baby! Hopefully you
          take time to remind yourself<br />
          everyday just how special you are -- especially since that sacred
          mommy and baby time will soon<br />
          have to include WORK. And let's talk about work because that is
          specifically what this website<br />
          is all about, but not just any work. We're talking about work at home
          with your newborn!<br />
          If you're here it's because you're looking for solutions to questions
          like, "How am I supposed<br />
          to work AND care for my newborn at the same time?" You're looking for
          ideas on ways to refresh<br />
          your work space to suite you and your baby. You're also looking for
          other mamas who are going<br />
          through the same thing because lately you've been thinking, "I can't
          be the ONLY mama going<br />
          through these struggles!" You are not alone! We welcome you into this
          unique, but ever growing<br />
          group of mamas who are figuring it things out and sharing it all right
          here!

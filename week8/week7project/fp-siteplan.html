        <p>
          Imagine: You just had a baby. Congratulations! However, you're a
          working mom. You work from home and don't have anyone <br />
          else to help you take care of the baby during your working hours.
          Maybe you're breastfeeding. Maybe you have a job in <br />
          which you're constantly taking phone calls and can't have a screaming
          and crying baby in the background. What do you do? BabyandIWork.com is
          a one-stop idea shop on items that can be useful towards allowing a
          mom to work from home WITH a newborn. <br />
          From work desks to baby carriers, bottle holders and baby swings.
          We'll let you know what can help you and provide you with <br />
          links to buy them if you want. We'll also give you ideas of how you
          can set up your workspace to work for you and for baby. <br />
          You can also join our community of mothers and share your ideas that
          have helped you! Being a working mom is hard enough as it is. <br />
          With all the things you have to figure out, don't let working at home
          with your baby be one of them. <br />
          It is possible and BabyandIWork.com will show you how!

        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>
          Our target audience is specific: Post-partum mothers who work from
          home, but it will serve anyone who works from <br />
          home with no one to watch their newborn. These people are looking for
          solutions to a fairly new problem, thanks to COVID. <br />
          People are working from home now more than ever and that is the new
          norm. However, most people and families don't <br />
          have anyone to care for their child while they are working. This site
          will identify important baby items that can help <br />
          soothe and occupy baby along with links for these items. It will
          provide ideas for arranging your work environemnt so that <br />
          it is easier to work and care for baby. It will also have a community
          page so that mothers and more can share their ideas, <br />
          give product reviews, and share their experiences with eachother.<br />
          There is no other site like it, so there is possibility for very heavy
          traffic. Other sites assume that you have the option <br />
          to create your own schedule. That is not true for all work from home
          jobs.

        <p>
          Congratulations mama on your newborn! Yes, let's take a deep breath
          and have a moment to<br />
          celebrate you and the fact that you just had a baby! Hopefully you
          take time to remind yourself<br />
          everyday just how special you are -- especially since that sacred
          mommy and baby time will soon<br />
          have to include WORK. And let's talk about work because that is
          specifically what this website<br />
          is all about, but not just any work. We're talking about work at home
          with your newborn!<br />
          If you're here it's because you're looking for solutions to questions
          like, "How am I supposed<br />
          to work AND care for my newborn at the same time?" You're looking for
          ideas on ways to refresh<br />
          your work space to suite you and your baby. You're also looking for
          other mamas who are going<br />
          through the same thing because lately you've been thinking, "I can't
          be the ONLY mama going<br />
          through these struggles!" You are not alone! We welcome you into this
          unique, but ever growing<br />
          group of mamas who are figuring it things out and sharing it all right
          here!
        </p>
        <h4 class="Solutions page">Refresh, Reset, and Perhaps Buy</h4>
        <p>
          Working from home with a newborn requires some creativity and even
          some out of the box thinking.<br />
          We've come up with some good ideas for how to recreate your workspace
          and have also taken into account<br />
          that some of you mamas may be breastfeeding and some of you may be
          bottle feeding.
        </p>
        <h5>Sit Stand Desk and Baby Carrier</h5>
        <p>
          The sit stand desk/baby carrier is a great combination. You can stand
          and keep baby close to you<br />
          AND free your hands so that you can type and answer calls! Baby
          carriers come in a wide variety of prices<br />
          with the cheapest options being to get one from a second hand store
          like "A Child's Place" where they always<br />
          have a great selection of them to choose from. Sit stand desks do run
          pricer starting from around $200 and up.<br />
          It's a bit of a splurge, but it's worth it ESPECIALLY if you're
          breastfeeding. You can adjust your baby carrier<br />
          straps so that you can breastfeed baby in the carrier, HANDS FREE!
          This is the ultimate solution for those mamas<br />
          who don't have a flexible work-at-home schedule. (Try to add a youtube
        </p>
        <h5>Baby Bottle and Hands Free Bottle Carrier</h5>
        <p>
          If you're bottle feeding baby, a hands free bottle carrier will be a
          life/hand-saver. Baby can drink and<br />
          can continue to work. ***This may also be helpful for mamas who are
          breastfeeding also, but this will need to be paired with a good<br />
          Breast Pump. You may find that breastfeeding isn't working out, but
          still want make sure your baby is getting<br />
          your milk. You can pump during working hours and give baby the Hands
          Free Bottle Carrier to use. While you<br />
          your scheduled breaks you can then pump!

        <h4 class="Community page">Connect With Your People!</h4>
        <p>
          Being a work at home mom has its ups and downs. Yes, you have the
          option of rolling out of bed<br />
          and going straight to "work" or rather your home office. Yes, you get
          to avoid hours of traffic and<br />
          driving to work. You don't have to worry about packing a breakfast or
          a lunch because you can<br />
          take advantage of your 24 hour kitchen whenever you feel hungry. There
          are so many pros to<br />
          working from home. But wait a second, are you telling me that you also
          have a baby that you have<br />
          care for? Well, that just changes EVERYTHING now doesn't it? There are
          so many things that others don't realize are going on in the
          background as a work-at-home<br />
          mama with a newborn! Nothing like working to the tune of your newborn
          crying and possibly screaming<br />
          because surprise, surprise! -- baby is hungry or wants to be held or
          needs a diaper change. Whatever it is, that baby needs your attention
          RIGHT NOW, and now customer<br />
          or group meeting, or boss even, is going to change that. Not so easy
          typing out that report with one<br />
          hand while the other arm is holding baby. Don't even get me started
          with sleep deprivation - because<br />
          sleep is a distant memory -- sigh --. And yet there's sometimes an
          unspoken expectation to perform as<br />
          good, if not better than before returning from your amazing maternity
          leave vacation because let's face it:<br />
          you weren't working, so it was definitely a vacation! Does any of this
          resonate with you? Whatever you're going through, whatever you feel,
          join the<br />
          BabyandIWork mamas community and vent, chat, CONNECT!

        <h2>Meet My Family</h2>
        <strong>Hello everyone!</strong>
         Welcome to my page where you will get to know more about me and my family!

            <em>From the left to the right is my husband Wilber, myself, our son
                Jordan who is 4 weeks old, and our daughter Winter who is 6.</em>  I am in LOVE with my family and 
            am so GRATEFUL for them!  My husband and I both work full-time, though I am currently on leave

        <h2>Meet My Family</h2>
        <strong>Hello everyone!</strong>
         Welcome to my page where you will get to know more about me and my family!  
            Above is a picture of us.  
            <em>From the left to the right is my husband Wilber, myself, our son
                Jordan who is 4 weeks old, and our daughter Winter who is 6.</em>  I am in LOVE with my family and 
            am so GRATEFUL for them!  My husband and I both work full-time, though I am currently on leave
            until March.  Our daughter is in 1st grade and is doing great.  I'm currently in school and look for time 
            to study and to spend with family.  It's always a balancing act!

        Hello everyone!  Welcome to my page where you will get to know more about me and my family!  
            Above is a picture of us.  From the left to the right is my husband Wilber, myself, our son
            Jordan who is 4 weeks old, and our daughter Winter who is 6.  I am in LOVE with my family and 
            am so GRATEFUL for them!  My husband and I both work full-time, though I am currently on leave
            until March.  Our daughter is in 1st grade and is doing great.  We're not all work and no play.

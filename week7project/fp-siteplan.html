            <h3>Site Purpose with Goals</h3>
            <p>
                Imagine: You just had a baby.  Congratulations!  However, you're a working mom.  You work from home and don't have anyone <br> 
                else to help you take care of the baby during your working hours.  Maybe you're breastfeeding.  Maybe you have a job in <br>
                which you're constantly taking phone calls and can't have a screaming and crying baby in the background.  What do you do?  
                BabyandIWork.com is a one-stop idea shop on items that can be useful towards allowing a mom to work from home WITH a newborn. <br>
                From work desks to baby carriers, bottle holders and baby swings.  We'll let you know what can help you and provide you with <br>
                links to buy them if you want.  We'll also give you ideas of how you can set up your workspace to work for you and for baby. <br>
                You can also join our community of mothers and share your ideas that have helped you!
                Being a working mom is hard enough as it is. <br>
                With all the things you have to figure out, don't let working at home with your baby be one of them.  <br>
                It is possible and BabyandIWork.com will show you how!</p>

            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>
            Our target audience is specific: Post-partum mothers who work from home, but it will serve anyone who works from <br>
            home with no one to watch their newborn.  These people are looking for solutions to a fairly new problem, thanks to COVID. <br>
            People are working from home now more than ever and that is the new norm.  However, most people and families don't <br>
            have anyone to care for their child while they are working.  This site will identify important baby items that can help <br>
            soothe and occupy baby along with links for these items.  It will provide ideas for arranging your work environemnt so that <br>
            it is easier to work and care for baby. It will also have a community page so that mothers and more can share their ideas, <br>
            give product reviews, and share their experiences with eachother.<br>
            There is no other site like it, so there is possibility for very heavy traffic.  Other sites assume that you have the option <br>
            to create your own schedule.  That is not true for all work from home jobs. </p>
